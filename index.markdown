## Description

**PIntron** is a novel pipeline for gene-structure prediction based on spliced alignment of transcript sequences (ESTs and mRNAs) against a genomic sequence.

**PIntron** is composed by four steps:
Firstly, alternative alignments of expressed sequences to a reference
genomic sequence are implicitly computed and represented in a graph
(called *embedding graph*) by a novel fast spliced alignment procedure.
Secondly, biologically meaningful alignment are extracted.
Then, a consensus gene structure induced by the previously computed
alignments is determined based on a parsimony principle.
Finally, the resulting introns are reconciliated and classified
according to general biological criteria.

Please cite the following paper when using **PIntron**:

The program is developed and heavily tested on Linux, but it should
run also on OS X.

## Download

The latest source code version can be downloaded from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron) as a [zip](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/zipball/master) or as [tar](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/tarball/master) archive.
