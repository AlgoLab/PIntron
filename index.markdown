title: PIntron
---

A novel pipeline for gene-structure prediction based on spliced alignment of transcript sequences (ESTs and mRNAs) against a genomic sequence.

## Description

PIntron is composed by four steps: Firstly, alternative alignments of expressed sequences to a reference genomic sequence are implicitly computed and represented in a graph (called embedding graph) by a novel fast spliced alignment procedure. Secondly, biologically meaningful alignment are extracted. Then, a consensus gene structure induced by the previously computed alignments is determined based on a parsimony principle. Finally, the resulting introns are reconciliated and classified according to general biological criteria.

A detailed description of the pipeline is available [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1514).

Please refer to the file [dist-docs/README.md](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/blob/master/dist-docs/README.md) for the detailed usage notes.
