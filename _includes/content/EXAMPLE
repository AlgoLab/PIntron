The following example briefly demonstrates how **PIntron** can be used
to predict the full-length isoforms of a gene
([TP53](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157)) starting from its
associated UniGene cluster
([Hs.437460](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/clust.cgi?ORG=Hs&CID=437460)).

This page is only a brief introduction to **PIntron**.
Please refer to the full [documentation](documentation.html) for a
complete description of its options.

## Preparation

Download and install **PIntron** as described [here](install.html).

In the rest of this example, we will assume that **PIntron** executables
have been installed in directory `/home/pintron/bin`.
Please substitute `/home/pintron/bin` with the directory where
**PIntron** has been installed to (or omit the path if **PIntron**
executables are in a directory listed in  `$PATH`).



## Input files

**PIntron** requires two input files: the
genomic sequence (in this case `genomic.txt`), and the EST/mRNA
sequences (in this case `ests.txt`), specified respectively with the
options `-g` and `-s`.
File `genomic.txt` is a FASTA file containing a single sequence, while
`ests.txt` is a MultiFASTA file, where each sequence is considered as a
single transcript (EST or mRNA).  
We strictly require a specific header format.
Please refer to the
[documentation](documentation.html#input_file_formats) for a detailed
description.

The input files for this example are located in the subdirectory
`dist-docs/example` and are also available for download
([genomic.txt](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/raw/master/dist-docs/example/genomic.txt),
[ests.txt](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/raw/master/dist-docs/example/ests.txt)).

After the preparation, the directory tree should be as follows (other
files may exist).

    /home/pintron
      ├── bin
      │   ├── cds-annotation
      │   ├── compact-compositions
      │   ├── est-fact
      │   ├── gene-structure
      │   ├── intron-agreement
      │   ├── maximal-transcripts
      │   ├── min-factorization
      │   └── pintron
      └── doc
          └── example
              ├── ests.txt
              └── genomic.txt


## Execution

Assuming that we want to generate all output files in the current working directory, the
following command executes **PIntron** on the example.

    /home/pintron/bin/pintron                               \
           --bin-dir=/home/pintron/bin                      \
           --genomic=/home/pintron/doc/example/genomic.txt  \
           --EST=/home/pintron/doc/example/ests.txt         \
           --organism=human                                 \
           --gene=TP53                                      \
           --output=pintron-full-output.json                \
           --gtf=pintron-cds-annotated-isoforms.gtf         \
           --extended-gtf=pintron-all-isoforms.gtf          \
           --logfile=pintron-pipeline-log.txt               \
           --general-logfile=pintron-log.txt


Most of the options have sensible default values and a short version.
Therefore, a shorter equivalent command line is:

    /home/pintron/bin/pintron                        \
           -b /home/pintron/bin                      \
           -g /home/pintron/doc/example/genomic.txt  \
           -s /home/pintron/doc/example/ests.txt     \
           -n human                                  \
           -e TP53


Please notice that options `--organism/-n` and `--gene/-e` are optional
and can be omitted (in that case, the default value `unknown` is assumed).


## Output files

**PIntron** produces the following output files:

* `pintron-full-output.json`, the complete description of the results
  computed by **PIntron** in
  [JSON format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
  This file is both human- and machine-readable (parsing libraries
  exist in all the major programming languages).
  Moreover, the format is almost self-documenting and can be easily
  adapted to the future needs.
  Please refer to its [description](documentation.html#json_output) for
  additional information.
* `pintron-all-isoforms.gtf`/`pintron-cds-annotated-isoforms.gtf`,
  the set of all (CDS-annotated, respectively) full-length isoforms
  computed by **PIntron** in standard
  [GTF2.2 format](http://mblab.wustl.edu/GTF22.html).
  These files can be used for some standard downstream analyzes.
  For example, they can be uploaded to the
  [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) as custom tracks (as
  shown in the example below).
* `pintron-log.txt`/`pintron-pipeline-log.txt`, the logs of main program
  and of each step of the pipeline.
  These files could contain important information if an error has
  occurred. Please upload them with any
  [issue report](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/issues).


The output files of **PIntron** on the example gene *TP53* are located
in the subdirectory `dist-docs/example/sample-output` while a graphical
representation of the reconstructed isoforms is as follows:
