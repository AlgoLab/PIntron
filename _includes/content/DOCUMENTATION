# PIntron - Documentation

This page provides a complete description of **PIntron** options.
Please refer to [this example](example.html) for a basic introduction.


## Input file formats

The genomic sequence file is a FASTA file whose header should adhere to the
following structure

      >chrZZ:start:end:strand

where:

- `ZZ` specifies the chromosome
- `start` and `end` specify the starting and ending positions of the genomic sequence
on the reference chromosome.
- `strand` specifies the strand of the genomic sequence and it must be +1 (5'3' direction)
or -1 (3'5' direction).

The provided nucleotide sequence must be on the direction specified by *strand* in the header
FASTA.
The genomic sequence file may have a FASTA header whose format is
different from the above standard *but*, in this case, rare prediction
errors might arise.

The file of transcripts is a multiFASTA file containing all the transcript sequences (ESTs and
mRNAs). The header of each sequence must contain the following field:

    /gb=XXXXXX

and it should contain the following field:

    /clone_end=YY

where `XXXXXX` is the GenBank accession number (or in any case a unique identifier within the input
  transcript file) and `YY` is the strand which the transcript has been read from. `YY` can
  be either `3'` (for direction 5'3', or strand +1)
  or `5'` (for direction 3'5', or strand -1).
  By default, when the `/clone_end` field is not specified, the transcript is
  considered on strand +1. Furthermore, a transcript
  sequence, that is also a RefSeq sequence, is forced on strand +1.


## List of command-line parameters

PIntron can be run with the following options:

* `-g`	`--genomic=FILE`		FILE containing the genomic sequence (*default=*genomic.txt)
* `-s`	`--est=FILE`            FILE containing the transcript sequences (*default=*ests.txt)
* `-o`	`--output=FILE`	output JSON FILE with ... (*default=*pintron-full-output.json)
* `-z`	`--compress`	compress output (*default=*no)
* `-l`	`--logfile=FILE`	output FILE containing a log of the whole pipeline (*default=*pintron-pipeline-log.txt)
*       `--general-logfile=pintron-log.txt` output FILE containing a
        log (*default=*pintron-log.txt)
* `-c`	`--do-not-continue`	do not resume a previously interrupted computation (*default=*no)
* `-b`	`--bin-dir=DIRECTORY`	DIRECTORY containing the programs (*default=*system PATH)
* `-n`	`--organism=NAME`	NAME of the organism originating the transcript sequences (*default=*unknown)
* `-e`	`--gene=NAME`	NAME of the gene originating the transcript sequences (*default=*unknown)
* `-k`	`--keep-intermediate-files`	keep all intermediate or temporary files  (*default=*no)
* `-t`  `--gtf=FILE` output GTF FILE with the isoforms that have a CDS annotation (*default=*pintron-cds-annotated-isoforms.gtf)
*       `--extended-gtf=pintron-all-isoforms.gtf` output extended GTF
        FILE with the all isoforms (*default=*pintron-all-isoforms.gtf)
* `--extended-gtf=FILE`	output GTF FILE with all the predicted isoforms (*default=*pintron-all-isoforms.gtf)
* `-a`	`--alignments`	output also the alignment of ESTs and genomic sequence. The alignments are stored in `est-alignments.sam` using a [SAM](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) format  (*default=*no)

A typical invocation of PIntron is:

    pintron --genomic=genomic.txt --est=ests.txt -z --output=pintron-full-output.json --logfile=pintron-log.txt

or, equivalently:

    pintron -g genomic.txt -s ests.txt -z -o pintron-full-output.json -l pintron-log.txt



### Advanced customization for experienced users

Some parameters can determine how much time can be spent in some
phases. Default values should be fine in almost all the cases.

* `--set-max-factorization-time=INT` time limit (in mins) for the spliced alignment step (*default=*60)
* `--set-max-factorization-memory=INT` limit (in MiB) for the memory used by the spliced alignment step (*default=*3000 MiB, approx. 3GB)
* `--set-max-exon-agreement-time=INT` time limit (in mins) for the exon agreement step (*default=*15)
* `--set-max-intron-agreement-time=INT` time limit (in mins) for
the intron agreement step (*default=*30)

Another parameter can influence the alignments computed.

* `--pas-tolerance=INT` Maximum allowed difference on the exon final
  coordinate to identify a PAS (*default=*30)

The user can choose the parameters to be used in the spliced alignment step, by providing an
optional config file (that must be named *config.ini*) in the current working directory.
The option *-k* allows keeping the dump file *config-dump.ini* of all the parameters actually used
in the spliced alignment step. Both files are composed of rows in the following format:

        <parameter>="<value>"

where:

- `<parameter>` is the name of a parameter
- `<value>` is the provided value.

An example of row is:

        min-factor-length="15"

Some significant parameters that the user can provide are:

* `min-factor-length` The length (nt) of the minimum common transcript-genome factor (*default=*15)
* `min-intron-length` The minimum length (nt) allowed for an intron (*default=*60)
* `max-intron-length`  The maximum length (nt) allowed for an intron (*default=*0, this parameter is ignored)
* `max-prefix-discarded` The maximum length (nt) of a transcript prefix that can be discarded. (*default=*50)
* `max-suffix-discarded` The maximum length (nt) of a transcript suffix that can be discarded. (*default=*50)
* `retain-externals` If *false*, discard the first (and the last, if a polyA chain has not been found) factors of
a spliced alignment. (*default=*true)

## Output




### JSON Output

The output file specified with the `--output` option is a JSON file, containing informations
  on the gene structure, the isoforms and the exons. Since JSON is mainly a
  (key, value) dictionary, we have chosen keys that are as self-explaining as
  possible. We have exploited the nesting nature of JSON files to
encode a set of gene where each gene has a set of isoforms and a set of
  introns.

Each gene has keys  "length_genomic_sequence",
  "version",  "number_isoforms", "isoforms" (a hash where a progressive ID is
  the only key and each value is a single isoform), "introns" (a list).

Each isoform has keys "canonical start codon?",
  "canonical end codon?", "NMD flag", "polyA?", "annotated CDS?", "start", "PAS?"
  "end", "number exons", "Type", "length", "coding length", "reference?", "from RefSeq?",
  "exons" (a list of exons).

Each exon has keys  "sequence", "relative start", "relative end",
  "chromosome start", "chromosome end" (absolute coordinates), "3utr length",
  "5utr length".

Each intron has keys "relative start", "relative end", "chromosome start",
"chromosome end", "length", "number supporting EST", "EST_list" (a list of EST
IDs), "donor alignment average error", "acceptor alignment average error", "donor score",
"acceptor score", "BPS score", "BPS position", "type", "pattern",
"repeat sequence", "donor suffix", "prefix", "suffix",
"acceptor prefix"

### GTF Output

* specified with the `--gtf` option is a standard GTF file, containing the isoforms that have a CDS annotation.
* specified with the `--extended-gtf` option is a GTF file, containing all the predicted isoforms.
