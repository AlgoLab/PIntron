## Download

PIntron is only distributed as source code.

The latest source code version can be downloaded from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron) as a [zip](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/zipball/master) or as [tar](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/tarball/master) archive.
It is also possible to clone the source repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron.git

We release only stable versions, therefore you are encouraged to
upgrade always to the latest version.
Anyway, older versions are also [available](https://github.com/AlgoLab/PIntron/tags).

## Requirements

PIntron requires the following free software:

- Python v3.0 or newer. Python v3.1 or newer is
  recommended
- Perl (tested on Perl v5.10.1 but it should work also with older
  versions)
- The JSON Perl module (available from CPAN). On most platforms, this
  module can be installed by using the command `cpan JSON` with
  administrator/superuser privileges (e.g., by using the command `sudo
  cpan JSON` on MacOS X)
- A recent version of the standard GNU toolchain (gcc, make).

## Compilation and Installation

PIntron is only distributed as source code and must be manually built.

The build process is driven by the GNU make utility and can be performed
by the following invocation:

    make dist

The command will produce a compressed archive `dist/pintron-*.tar.gz`
that can be used for the installation or the execution.

The binary package is composed by the directory `bin`, containing all the
executables needed to run PIntron, and the directory `doc`, containing
the documentation and a simple complete example.
For installing PIntron, you should copy the executables of the `bin/`
directory to a directory of the PATH or to a custom directory.
In the second case, you should specify the custom directory during the
PIntron invocation using the `--bin-dir` program option.
