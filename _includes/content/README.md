#  PIntron

A novel pipeline for gene-structure prediction based on
spliced alignment of transcript sequences (ESTs and mRNAs) against a genomic sequence.

## Description

This software implements a novel algorithm to efficiently predict the
(basic) gene structure by aligning expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and mRNAs against a genomic sequence.
